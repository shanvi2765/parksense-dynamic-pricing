# ParkSense: Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking
### üìÑ Project Overview
**ParkSense** is an intelligent, data-driven dynamic pricing system designed for urban parking lots. This capstone project, developed as part of the Summer Analytics 2025 program by IIT Guwahati, addresses the inefficiencies of static parking prices (like overcrowding or underutilization) by dynamically adjusting parking rates in real-time.
The system processes streaming data from multiple parking spaces, taking into account various parameters including occupancy, queue length, traffic conditions, special events, and vehicle types. It implements **three** progressively complex pricing models, culminating in a competitive pricing strategy, and visualizes real-time price fluctuations using interactive dashboards.
### Key Objectives
- Develop a robust dynamic pricing engine for multiple urban parking spaces.
- Implement pricing models from scratch using fundamental data science libraries.
- Utilize a real-time data streaming framework for continuous price updates.
- Provide interactive visualizations to demonstrate pricing behavior and justification.
### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project leverages a powerful combination of Python libraries and tools for data processing, modeling, and visualization:
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for numerical computing, used for efficient array operations and linear algebra (e.g., Normal Equation for linear regression).
- **Pandas**: Essential for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis of historical parking data.
- **Pathway**: A high-performance Python framework for building real-time data streaming applications. Used for ingesting, processing, and transforming data streams.
- **Bokeh**: An interactive visualization library for creating dynamic and real-time plots that render in web browsers. Used for visualizing live price updates across parking lots.
- **Panel**: A library for creating custom interactive dashboards and web applications, seamlessly integrating with Bokeh plots to present the real-time insights.
- **Google Colab**: The development environment used for writing and executing the Python code.
